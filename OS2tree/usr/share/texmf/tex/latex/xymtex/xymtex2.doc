`XyMTeX' is a macro package for drawing chemical structural formulas. 

(1) Setting up 

    This package has been frozen with LHA.  Let the frozen package 
  (xymtex2.lzh) be placed in the b: directory.  To melt the frozen package 
  in the a:\tex directory, please input the following statement in the 
  command line of your display. 

     a:\tex>lha x b:\xymtex2

  Thereby, the directory <\xymtex> is automatically created as the 
  subdirectory of the a:\tex directory; and the following hierarchy of 
  directories and files is generated. 

  a---\tex---\xymtex --- hetaromh.sty, hetarom.sty, ccycle.sty, 
    |      |          |   chemstr.sty, carom.sty, lowcycl.sty, aliphat.sty, 
                      |   hcycle.sty, locant.sty, polymers.sty, chemist.sty
                      |   methylen.sty, fusering.sty
                      |
                      |   (dtx files)
                      |
                      |--\drvdvi---drv files, dvi files
                      |
                      |--\doc200--- xymtx200.tex, xymtx200.dvi,
                      |    xymyl.tex, xymadd.tex 
                      |    (other files for the document preparation)
                      |
                      |---xymtex2.doc (this document)
                      |
                      |---xymtex2.jpn (on-line document in Japanes)
                      |
                      |---readme2.doc (notes in English)
                      |
                      |---readme2.jpn (notes in Japanese)

   The package (sty) files in the \xymtex directory contains the macro 
  codes of XymTeX commands. The specification of XyMTeX commands and 
  examples of using these commands are included in the xymtex.dvi file of 
  the \doc directory. 

   The xymtx200.dvi file is a dvi file that is a manual for utilizing 
  XyMTeX (about 100 pages). The processed dvi file can be obtained in the same 
  directory of this distribution.  It can be printed with an appropriate 
  printer driver (lips3dvi, dviprt, or others) and can be displayed with an 
  appropriate previewer (dviout, etc.). 

   The xymtx200.tex is the main file of the manuscript for creating the 
  xymtx200.dvi. The other tex files in the \doc200 directory are input files 
  which are read by the main file. 

(2) Designating a serach path 

  In order to set a search path for using XyMTeX, please add the directory 
  name to the TEXINPUTS line in \texmf.cnf, which is stored in the 
  \tex\texmf\web2c directory (for a standard distribution of LaTeX2e). 
  For example, you add 

   platex2e_inputs = .;$TEXMF/tex/platex2e//;$TEXMF/tex/latex2e//;
    $TEXMF/tex//;a:/tex/inputs//;
    a:/tex/chem//;a:/tex/xymtex//;a:/tex/opsty//
                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ <---- to be added 

(3) Writing your manuscript 

   Each command of XyMTeX can be used if you add the name of the 
   corresponding style file to the option list at the top of your 
   manuscript file, e.g. 

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{epic,hetarom,hetaromh}
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  where the underlined names are XyMTeX package files containing your 
  requisite commands. If all of the XyMTeX commands are required, 
  the short-cut declaration 

    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{xymtex}
 
  can be used for simplicity. 

(4) Running LaTeX2e or pLaTeX2e

   You should use XyMTeX commands within LaTeX.
