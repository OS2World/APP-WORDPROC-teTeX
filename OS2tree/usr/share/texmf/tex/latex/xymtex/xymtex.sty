% This file is a part of the macro package ``XyMTeX'' which has been 
% designed for typesetting chemical structural formulas.
%
% This file is to be contained in the ``xymtex'' directory which is 
% an input directory for TeX. It is a LaTeX optional style file and 
% should be used only within LaTeX, because several macros of the file 
% are based on LaTeX commands. 
%
% For the review of XyMTeX, see
%  (1)  Shinsaku Fujita, ``Typesetting structural formulas with the text
%    formatter TeX/LaTeX'', Computers and Chemistry, 18, 109--116 (1994). 
% The following book deals with an application of TeX/LaTeX to 
% preparation of manuscripts of chemical fields:

%    formulas'', TUGboat, 16(1), 80--88 (1995).
